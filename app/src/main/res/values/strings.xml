    <string name="story1">  We were the masters of this world.\n
    We lived in harmony with nature, \n maintaining a fragile balance of life. ==
    We kept the Tree \n that feeds the whole world. ==
    The forest was our home, \n its inhabitants were brothers, \n and nature was the mother. ==
    Our happiness lasted for centuries. \n We believed that it was eternal. ==
    But They came. ==
    They came from heaven \n on stone monsters spewing flames. ==
    They destroyed the forest \n, leaving behind them the bare and desecrated land. ==
    We quietly retreated into the depths of our native lands, \n hoping for the strength of the Tree. ==
    But they got to it. ==
    To the Tree, \n that fed the vital forces of our entire fragile world. ==
    That was the last straw! ==
    We went out of war. ==
    In the name of the Valley! \n
    In the name of Life! ==
    Ten nights lasted that battle \n
    Calling all the remaining forces to help \n
    We held on to the last ==
    But were broken. ==
    Many died on that fateful day. ==
    But all troubles faded before the death of the Tree. \n
    They destroyed the Tree \n and took the Fruit ==
    Valley wilted ==
    We gathered the remnants of our nations great council and decided. ==
    The valley cannot be saved ==
    Our people go to the mountains. \n
    Where we can hide from the enemy \n
    And calmly live out your years. ==
    For many, the Valley has become lost forever \n
    But there are rumors about the Chosen One, \n
    That according to legend, will appear at the last moment, invisible, and inaudible. ==
    And he can stop the invaders, \n return the Fruit of Life to the fold of the Valley \n and revive the Tree. ==
    They will not notice his appearance, \n but only they will feel in whose hearts \n hope is still alive. ==
    He will restore the balance of power, and return the lost lands to the people. ==
    The Chosen One is you! ==
    Only you can breathe life into the Valley again. ==
    But be careful \n
    There are many dangers on your way. \n
    The worst of which are
    Splits, created by the Fetus \n
    Beware of them ==
    We can only leave you messages like this. \n
    And guide you, because you donâ€™t know much ==
    Bon voyage \n
    Valley in your hands==
